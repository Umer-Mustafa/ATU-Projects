		<h2>Teatro Di San Carlo</h2>
		<p>Teatro Di San Carlo (Royal Theatre of Saint Charles),. is an opera house in Naples and is connected to the Royal Palace and adjacent to the Piazza Del Plebiscito. It is the oldest continuously active venue for opera in the world, having opened in 1737, decades before either Milan's La Scala or Venice's La Fenice. The opera season runs from late January to May, with the ballet season taking place from April to early June. The house had a seating capacity of 3,285 but this has been reduced to 1,386 seats. Given the size, structure and antiquity, it was the model for theatres that were later built in Europe.</p>

	  <h2>Castel dell'Ovo</h2>
		<p>Castel dell'Ovo is a seafront castle in Naples, located on the former island of Megaride, now a peninsula, on the Gulf of Naples in Italy and is the oldest standing fortification in Naples. The castle's name comes from a legend about the Roman poet Virgil, who had a reputation in the Middle Ages as a great sorcerer and predictor of the future. In the legend, Virgil put a magical egg into the foundations to support the fortifications. It remains there along with his bones, and had this egg been broken, the castle would have been destroyed, and a series of disastrous events for Naples would have followed.</p>
