		<h2>Rome - Colosseum</h2>
		<p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age.  It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000, it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome despite being 1,942 years old.</p>

	  <h2>Pisa - Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2>
		<p>Torre Pendente di Pisa (Leaning Tower of Pisa) is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres on the low side and 56.67 metres on the high side and its weight is an estimated 14,500 tonnes. The tower began leaning in the 12th century due to the soft ground and the weight.</p>
